# Project 2

### Create a new markdown file and upload it to your GitHub repository.  Provide a link to your newly created `project2.md` file from your main index.  Populate your newly created markdown file with your answers to the following questions.  Upload your response no later than midnight on Wednesday, March 3rd.

- Describe continuous, ordinal and nominal data.  Provide examples of each.  Is it possible to specify a model that has variables of varying data types?  Describe a model of your own construction that incorporates variables of each type of data.  You are perfectly welcome to describe your model using english rather than mathematical notation if you prefer.  Include variables that represent your features and targets.

- Comment out the seed from your randomly generated data set of 1000 observations and use the beta distribution to produce a plot that has a mean that approximates the 50th percentile.  Also produce both a right skewed and left skewed plot by modifying the alpha and beta parameters from the distribution.  Be sure to modify the widths of your columns in order to improve legibility of the bins (intervals).

-  Using the gapminder data set, produce two overlapping histograms within the same plot describing life expectancy in 1952 and 2007.  Plot the overlapping histograms using both the raw data and then after applying a logarithmic transformation (`np.log10()` is fine).  Which of the two resulting plots best communicates the change in life expectancy amongst all of these countries from 1952 to 2007?

- Using the seaborn library of functions, produce a box and whiskers plot of population for all countries at the given 5-year intervals.  Also apply a logarithmic transformation to this data and produce a second plot.  Which of the two resulting box and whiskers plots best communicates the change in population amongst all of these countries from 1952 to 2007?
